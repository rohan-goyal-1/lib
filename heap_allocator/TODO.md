# 1. Alignment Support
+ Implement alignment support to ensure that allocated memory blocks are aligned to certain boundaries (e.g., 4-byte, 8-byte, or custom alignments).
# 2. Thread Safety
+ Make the allocator thread-safe by adding appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, atomic operations) to protect shared data structures like free_list and total_allocated_memory.
# 3. Error Handling and Debugging
+ Improve error handling and debugging capabilities:
+ Add logging or debugging messages for easier troubleshooting.
+ Implement error checks (e.g., NULL pointer checks) in functions like malloc, free, and realloc.
# 4. Efficiency Improvements
+ Optimize the allocator for performance:
+ Consider different strategies for block splitting and coalescing to minimize fragmentation and improve allocation speed.
+ Use more sophisticated data structures for free_list management, such as segregated free lists or buddy allocators for different block sizes.
# 5. Memory Protection and Safety
+ Enhance memory protection and safety:
+ Implement guard bytes or canaries around allocated blocks to detect buffer overflows or corruption.
+ Add checks for double-free or use-after-free errors.
# 6. Variable Block Sizes
+ Support variable block sizes instead of a fixed HEAP_SIZE, allowing dynamic resizing or growth of the heap.
# 7. Statistics and Metrics
+ Track and expose allocator statistics:
+ Number of allocations, frees, and current memory usage.
+ Implement functions to query these statistics for profiling and monitoring purposes.
# 8. Fragmentation Reduction
+ Implement strategies to reduce fragmentation:
+ Defragmentation routines to consolidate free blocks.
+ Coalescing adjacent free blocks during allocation and deallocation.
